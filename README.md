# Kupidonchik

## Description
Kupidonchik is a Telegram bot designed to find friends and relationships. It was created as an alternative to the popular "ДайВинчик" bot and offers users a user-friendly interface for interacting with potential partners.

## Technologies
The project was developed using the Python programming language and the Telebot library, which provides the flexibility and scalability of the bot. An efficient SQLite3 database is used for data storage.

## Functionality
- Search for partners according to the specified criteria (age, city, gender).
- Interact with users through intuitive commands.
- Privacy of user data due to a reliable information storage system.

## Getting started
To start using the bot, you need to:
1. Add scripts to the virtual environment and install libraries: 'telebot' and 're'
2. Create a bot in BotFather
3. Write the bot token to a file config.py
4. Run the file main.py
5. Go to your Telegram bot
6. Send the /start command and follow the instructions in the bot

## Development and support
This is my first project, and I admit that it may not be the most optimized. However, I am constantly working to improve its performance and appearance. Your feedback and suggestions will help make Kupidonchik better.
